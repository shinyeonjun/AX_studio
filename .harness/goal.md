# Goal: Work Discovery correctness-first completion

Complete Work Discovery so teach-by-example flows are verified end-to-end:
historical output + optional input → observe → source inventory → synthesize/replay → clarify → compile → publish → runtime execution.

## Success criteria
- North-star E2E passes (`packages/core/src/work-discovery/e2e/work-discovery-e2e.test.ts`)
- `compileBlueprintToWorkflow` preserves `fields[].mapping` via `transform.evaluate`
- ALL-pass multi-example replay; truncated aggregate rejection
- Required observation publish gate; scoped clarification
- `inputArtifactIds` consumed via `DiscoverySourceProvider` registry
- `npm run build -w @ax-studio/core` passes
- `npm test -w @ax-studio/core` passes (359+ tests)
- `npm run eval -w @ax-studio/core` passes
- `npx tsc --noEmit -p apps/desktop/tsconfig.json` passes
- `npm run build -w @ax-studio/desktop` passes
- document-engine pytest passes

## Non-goals
- Schema drift auto-repair (fixture only)
- Agent semantic synthesis harness (deferred; deterministic path first)
- Phases 9–10 drift/repair productization
